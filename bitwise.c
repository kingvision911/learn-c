// Bitwise operators 
// in arthmetic=logic unit (cpu) mathematical operations like addition, subtractions, multiplications, and division are done in bit - wise level 
// to perform bit level operations in c programming bitwise operation are used.
// Types of bitwise operations 
//     OPERATORS  				MEANING OF OPERATORS
//    1 & 					Bitwise AND
//    2 |					Bitwise OR
//    3 ^ 					Bitwise x OR 
//    4 ~         				Bitwise compliment
//    5 <<					shift left
//    6 >> 					shift Right
//
//BITWISE AND OPERATOR (&)
//	The output of Bitwise AND operators is 1 if the corrsponding two bits of two operand is 1
//	if either bit of an operand is 0, the result of the corresponidg bit evaluated to 0.
